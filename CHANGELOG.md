# Changelog

## 3.0.0 XXXX-XX-XX (Unreleased)

New features:

- jQuery is not needed anymore, now, Sidr is just a JS library which is available also as a jQuery Plugin
- `left`/`right` transforms replaced with CSS3 2D Transforms (translateX) (TODO)
- New `reload` method to make easier to handle dynamic data, eliminating the need of destroying it and reinstantiate the slider. Thanks to @liladani: <https://github.com/artberri/sidr/pull/176>
- New displace format resizing body. Thanks to @p0lar-bear: <https://github.com/artberri/sidr/pull/150> (TODO)
- Allow to keep menus opened. Thanks to @wtfred: https://github.com/artberri/sidr/pull/181 (TODO)

Breaking changes:

- Option 'bind' (event that triggers the menu) allows only a single event
- Default value for 'bind' (event that triggers the menu) is now `click` (it was `touchstart click`, both)
- Drop support for browsers not supporting animations
- Classes added to the menus change from `left` and `right` to `sidr-left` and `sidr-right` to avoid collisions
- Supports only browsers that natively support the following features:
  - <https://caniuse.com/#search=querySelectorAll>
  - <https://caniuse.com/#feat=classlist>
  - <https://caniuse.com/#search=transitions>
  - <https://caniuse.com/#search=CSS3%202D%20Transforms>

Internals:

- Update dev dependencies
- Switch from Grunt to NPM Scripts
- Switch from SASS + COMPASS to PostCSS
- Switch from PhantomJS to Headless Chrome for testing

## 2.1.0 2016-01-20

New features:

- Now it works with CSS3 transitions by default and fallbacks to jQuery.animate when not supported
- Added `timing` option that can be used to indicate the transition timing function for the CSS3 transitions

- Added `onOpenEnd` option to add a callback that will be fired when the menu ends opening
- Added `onCloseEnd` option to add a callback that will be fired when the menu ends closing

Bug fixes:

- Launch callback when a menu open is delayed until another one is closed
- Fixes bug introduced in 2.0.0 that added a method called 'undefined' in addition to the methods close, open, toggle
