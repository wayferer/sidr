# Sidr Examples

You can see here some dummy examples with different common situations.

## Running the examples locally

Ensure that you have [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and [npm](http://npmjs.org/) installed. The best way to do it is through [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm).

1. Fork and clone the repo.
1. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies.
1. Run `grunt serve` to create a local server

The browser should open automatically with the sample index.
